I couldn't even find the word Joseon in the Chudo Sik site. The representative of the Japanese government, who was controversial about Yasukuni Shinsa, attended the Chudo Sik site. There was no content to reflect on forced labor. Hyeon Young-joon from Sado Gwangsan is reporting. Today afternoon, Sado Island, Niigata Prefecture. Sado Gwangsan Chudo Sik was held at the Aikawa Development Joint Center. The word Joseon was not included in the Chudo Sik site. The Japanese side said it was an event to recruit all the workers who worked in Gwangsan. Because our government declared a full-scale fire the day before the event, Half of the seats were empty and half of them were Chudo Siks. Ikuina Akiko, who represented the Japanese government, also mentioned the harsh labor environment of Joseon workers at the Chudo Sik site. The workers who came from the Korean Peninsula are in a special social situation called war. They are far away from their hometown, thinking about their loved family, but they are in a dangerous and harsh environment. However, there was no content to talk about forced labor and their criticism or reflection. This Chudo Sik was held at Sado Gwangsan World Heritage Site in July. The Korean government, which was the second country, agreed to the event, and promised that the Japanese side would recruit the victims of Joseon every year. However, following the Chudo Sik controversy, the Yasukuni Shinsa Chanbae strategy was known by the Ikuina government, and criticism was raised in Korea. After the event, the Ikuina government, who left through the back door to avoid the reporters, did not reveal its position until the end of the Yasukuni Shinsa Chanbae controversy. The Japanese government said that the Korean-Japanese government had continued sincere communication between the Korean-Japanese government through the statement that the Korean side was not involved. This is Hyun Young-joon from MBC News in Sado Island. The Korean government is planning to hold a separate Chudo Sik tomorrow with the Japanese. The Japanese government expressed its dissatisfaction with the Korean side, but the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not make any statements such as protest or dissatisfaction. There is a criticism that the Korean side will be fired tomorrow. This is Jang Yu-jin. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will hold a separate Chudo Sik for our government in the dormitory near Sado Gwangsan tomorrow morning. Nine children of the victims of forced mobilization will attend the Chudo Sik, and Park Chul-hee, a Korean ambassador, will attend. There are no Japanese participants. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will hold its own Chudo Sik for the participants of the event. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Chudo Sik for the participants of the event is an expression of firm will of the Korean government that it will not compromise on the past. It said that it will continue to work for the development of bilateral relations that are in line with the interests of both Korea and Japan based on these principles. However, the reason why the Korean government agreed to the World Heritage site of Sado Gwangsan is because Japan said it would hold a Chudo Sik for the victims of forced mobilization every year. There is a criticism that why Japan agreed to the World Heritage site if it is going to hold its own Chudo Sik for the victims of forced mobilization. The Japanese government did not even protest or express its opinion on Japan's unilateral Chudo Sik. It is unable to present its position on the Chudo Sik for next year. There is a voice of criticism in politics. In addition, the Democratic Party said that it is only an indisputable declaration that it will hold a Chudo Sik for the victims of forced mobilization every year. The Jindo Party also criticized the Korean people for their insolence and insolence. However, the power of the people did not reveal the official position on the Chudo Sik for the victims of forced mobilization. This is Jang Hyo-jin from MBC News. Today's event was a Chudo Sik for the victims of forced mobilization. The Chudo Sik started at 1 p.m. and ended in just an hour. At first, there were more than 100 people who could attend, but because half of the seats were empty, the atmosphere was heavy and cold. The Japanese representative, Ikkun and Akiko, who attended the event, had a stiff expression throughout the event. During today's event, there was a time of silence for all workers of Sado Gangsan. The Japanese government suggested that it hold a Chudo Sik for the victims of forced mobilization, but it was known that the Japanese did not accept it and declared an indisputable declaration. The Japanese government declared an indisputable declaration the day before the Chudo Sik. It's an unusual thing to see the foreign policy. What is the Japanese's position and atmosphere on this? NHK and other Japanese media are also focusing on the news of the Chudo Sik indisputable. In particular, some media reported that the Japanese government did not hold an indisputable declaration after the Chudo Sik indisputable declaration. The Japanese ambassador also made the same statement. It seems that they are trying to pass the responsibility of Chudo Sik indisputable to the Japanese government. Foreign ministry reported Masamune Ill facing a criminal charge in the time they rhyme together that Korea-Japan relations might be exposed, pleading guilty to bad 너무. Especially, this Chudo Sik indisputable made by Sado is an exercise culprit problem because both countries cannot turn down to each other at Chudo Sik indisputable, so Gyeongsang branch could not find a solution and the jellyfish. It seems like it's a lie. So far, I have delivered it from Sado Island. In addition, the Democratic Party of Korea today, Mr. Myung Tae-kyun, the National Assembly of Korea, I'm a member of the Seoul Seochogap Re-election. I revealed the recording that contained the panic. The Democratic Party of Korea has been named as a member of the party. I received a name and I threw away the illegal research. I claimed to be suspicious. It seems like a false story. This is Kim Ji-in. February 8, 2022 The re-election of the National Assembly of Korea will be held two days in advance. This is the recording of Mr. Myung Tae-kyun and Mr. Kang Hye-kyung. If the final vote is good, When Lee Hye-woon did that, Who do you support? I put another text. It is an order to modify the text of the Seoul Seochogap Re-election. When Mr. Kang Hye-kyung becomes a problem later, When Mr. Kang Hye-kyung becomes a problem later, When Mr. Kang Hye-kyung becomes a problem later, You can make it later, if it becomes a problem. You can tell your husband to use it. He said he would do it on his own, He said he would do it on his own, If I see money coming in and out after the problem is solved, If I see money coming in and out after the problem is solved, I'll do that for you. After receiving a call from Mr. Myung that he would be a problem from the party, He did not give up on the already conducted research. Did you change from the party and come back to do the research? If it becomes a problem later, All you have to do is clean up what you don't know. The Democratic Party said that Mr. Myung handed over the name of the party member from Mr. Cho He claimed that he was suspicious of throwing away the illegal research. Mr. Cho voted for more than half of the five candidates in the campaign at the time He received a contribution without a draw. Mr. Myung mentioned Mr. Cho, It has recently been revealed. Mr. Cho called me earlier. He made me Cho Eun-hee. He made Kim Young-sun. Mr. Myung is now the emperor of Yeongnam. It was given by the four presidents. I didn't do it. Mr. Cho said it was a vain novel. It's true that Mr. Myung suggested ARS, I refused because there was no failure in the investigation. This is Kim Ji-in from MBC News. The investigation is expanding as a party politician at the Sangwon District Prosecutor's Office. Oh Se-yoon's acquaintance and a large-scale supporter In the 2021 Seoul Market Competition process, Mr. Myung Taek-yoon sent 33 million won with the cost of his research. He admitted the fact. However, this candidate, this supporter, Mr. Oh explained that he didn't know. Reporter Kim Sang-hoon covered it. This is the content of his account released by Kang Hye-kyung, who worked at the Future Korea Research Institute. Mr. Kim, who has been known as a long supporter of Oh Se-yoon's Seoul Market, In the 2021 Seoul Market Competition process, He said he spent 33 million won five times. It was a non-published research cost for Mr. Oh. Mr. Kim admitted the fact that he paid for MBC's research. However, Mr. Oh didn't know about this. He claimed that it was personally cost. I'm a member of the Republican Party, and I like Oh Se-yoon, and I helped him. Do you know Mr. Oh Se-yoon? I don't know. Mr. Myung Taek-yoon said this. I can make the station rich. I heard you're good at that. Mr. Kim said that Mr. Myung Taek-yoon reported the results of the research to Kim Jong-in's vice chairman at the time. Kim Jong-in's former chairman recently confirmed to his secretary Mr. Myung sent a survey result to the secretary's email. The secretary said he had given it to me. He answered MBC. But it had no effect on the competition. It was a meaningless survey. Mr. Oh said in February 2021, Mr. Myung showed one of the results of the survey with Kim Young-sun's former congressman. I've done it before, but I sent it back and didn't communicate. He said he didn't even know about the money trade. The US-Korea Research Institute conducted 13 unannounced research on Mr. Oh. The research conducted with the money Mr. Kim made was also reported to Mr. Kim Jong-in, who was leading the people at the time. If Mr. Kim found out about the fact that Mr. Oh paid for the research, it could be a violation of the Politburo Act. The prosecutor will call Kang Hye-kyung again tomorrow to conduct additional investigations. It seems that the investigation will be expanded to Mr. Kim and Mr. Oh. This is MBC News' Kim Sang-hoon. It is known that President Yun Sung-ryul and Mrs. Kim Geon-hee stopped the use of personal cell phones and re-opened new cell phones. President Yun said at a press conference on July 7th, that he and his wife had to change their cell phones. He said he would do everything to prevent the people from worrying. The president and the officials said that there would be changes in the communication system.
